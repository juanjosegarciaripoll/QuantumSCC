# QuantumSCC:

## A Python Package for Automated Derivation and Diagonalization of Superconducting Circuit Hamiltonians

QuantumSCC is an open-source Python package designed to automate the derivation of
superconducting circuit Hamiltonians. The algorithm developed and implemented in the package is based on the 
approach proposed by Parra-Rodriguez and Egusquiza [1,2]. Furthermore, the program also incorporate advance tools 
for diagonalization of linear circuit Hamiltonians. Future work includes completing the diagonalization algorithm, making the package able to diagonalize nonlinear circuit Hamiltonians; introduce additional circuit components to the circuit configuration; and add the possible interaction between the circuit and an external electromagnetic field.
